## Nand2Tetris

This folder contains chapter from 1 to 12 each dedicated to a key hardware or software abstraction, implementation and an actual project tha builds and tests.

### Nand2Tetris - Outline (6 months)

#### Section 1 
Boolean Logic
  - This chapter is about building basic chips called Boolean gates, which represent Boolean functions. It starts with a brief look at Boolean algebra, then shows how these gates can be linked together for more complex tasks. Finally, it explains how hardware design is typically done using software simulation tools.

#### Section 2
Boolean Arithmetic
  - In this chapter, we create logic designs using gates to work with numbers and perform arithmetic operations. We begin with the logic gates introduced in Chapter 1 and end with a fully operational Arithmetic Logical Unit.

#### Section 3
Sequential Logic
  - In this section, we transition from combinational to sequential chips, essential for storing data in computers. We explore memory elements built from flip-flops, detailing clocks, binary cells, registers, and more, culminating in a complete computer system.
