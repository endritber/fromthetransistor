# From the Transistor to the Web Browser - George Hotz

Also a combination with [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course!

I'll start with the Nand2Tetris course, which is shorter and provides a solid foundation. After that, I'll tackle George's advanced topics. My aim is to finish both courses this year and be an actual computer scientist.
